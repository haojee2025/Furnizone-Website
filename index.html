            Furnizone Industries Sdn Bhd began its humble beginnings in 2009 as Malaysia’s knockdown particle board (engineered wood) furniture manufacturer. 
            Today the business has bloomed, with almost 100 employees and a factory that’s 7,000 square meters.<br><br>
            We have an excellent team in research and development to customize trendy pieces of wardrobe, bedroom sets, children sets,
            living room furniture, children's cabinet, kitchen cabinet, and hallway furniture.<br><br>
            Our company has built a reputation as a reputable panel board base furniture maker for over the decade.
            Our success is due not only to the company’s efficient ability to produce the goods ordered with a short
            manufacturing lead time but also to the credit of the R&D process, which allows the market to experience
            creative and trendy goods. In addition, 90% of the items are shipped to other countries.<br><br>
            We manufacture our furniture on a vast scale with superior furniture manufacturing technologies. In our
            factory, we have a variety of high-tech machines, including a high-speed auto panel saw machine, a CNC
            machine, a high-end edge banding machine, and automatic boring machines. In addition, our business has
            a smooth conveyor system that delivers excellent production while reducing error and lost time.
